[How to write a video script for YouTube (epidemicsound.com)](https://www.epidemicsound.com/blog/how-to-write-a-video-script-for-youtube/)

## Research

_*This is where you can gather all the research you’re doing for the video_

## Brief

_*Write out a short description of the video, no longer than 2-3 sentences long._

## Outline

_*This is more of a sketch than a video script – bullet-points will be fine. The purpose of the outline is to summarize the video_

## The Hook

_*The thing to hook viewers in with, the selling point. One of two ways:_

  1. _The straight hook, which tells the viewer what they’re going to watch, and then you take them through the process step-by-step._
  2. _In media res, which places the viewer in the action and then shows how we ended up there._

## The Script

_*Here you can write the full script in one go. Write it however you want._

## Script - 3 Act Structure

_*Alternatively you can write out the script in a **3 Act Structure**. If not, remove this part._
