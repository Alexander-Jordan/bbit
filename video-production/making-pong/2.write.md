## The Hook

_*The thing to hook viewers in with, the selling point. One of two ways:_

  1. _The straight hook, which tells the viewer what theyâ€™re going to watch, and then you take them through the process step-by-step._
  2. _In medias res (latin), which places the viewer in the action and then shows how we ended up there._
