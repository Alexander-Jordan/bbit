## The Hook

Introduce what Pong is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made Pong in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro
- Short Pong history
  ```
  Manufactured and released by Atari on November 29th, 1972, Pong was to become the first successful commercial game.
  Since then, countless remakes have been made.
  ```
- The 20 games challenge
  ```
  I'm participating in a challenge to recreate 20 existing games.
  My first game is Pong, and I wanted to briefly show what steps I took to remake it in Godot.
  In the end I will share the source code for anyone interested in the details.
  ```

### Add the basics
- Add walls
  ```
  In my main scene, I start by adding 4 walls.
  The top and bottom will always be enabled, but the right and left wall will only be enabled when the game is over.
  This will make the ball bounce around forever when the game has ended.
  ```
- Add paddles
  ```
  The paddle was made into a separate scene.
  After implementing the movement & instantiating 2 paddles in the main scene, I could now move both paddles with W & S and UP & DOWN arrows.
  ```
- Add a ball and points
  ```
  Then I added a ball that bounces off of the walls & paddles.
  A GameManager will add points properly when the ball exits the screen and re-serve the ball.
  A game ends whenever a player reaches 11 points.
  Now the game loop and the basics are in place.
  ```

### Add more 
- Custom bounce on paddles
  ```
  Like in the original, the ball should change trajectory depending on where on the paddle it hits.
  The same goes for the speed increase of the ball.
  So now the closer the ball hits the edge of a paddle, the greater the angle and speed increase of the bounce.
  ```
- Add menus (main, pause, settings)
  ```
  Regarding menus, I made a main, pause, and settings menu.
  The settings menu includes customizable gameplay properties, such as the size and speed of the ball and paddles.
  I also made some templates such as a Classic template, that plays close to the original.
  ```
- Add AI
  ```
  I also added some simple AI, and you can choose which paddle should have an AI and which shouldn't.
  So now both players and AI can play against AI.
  ```

### Final touches
- Add basic audio (SFX)
  ```
  For SFX I used an online tool called JSFXR.
  ```
- Add a splash screen and icon
  ```
  Lastly, I made a splash screen and a game icon.
  ```

### Outro
```
And that was it!
The game is on Itch and the source code is on GitHub.
The links for both of them are in the description.
I also remade Flappy Bird as the second game of the challenge, so subscribe if you want to see that video.
Alright, take care!
