## The Hook

Introduce what Pong is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made Pong in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro
- Short Pong history
  ```
  Manufactured and released by Atari on November 29th, 1972, Pong was to become the first successful commercial game.
  Since then, countless remakes have been made, making it one of the most popular first-game-to-make as an aspiring indie game dev.
  ```
- The 20 games challenge
  ```
  I'm participating in the '20 Games Challenge', which is about recreating 20 existing games.
  One of the first games to be remade is Pong, and this is my take on it.
  ```

### Add the basics
- Add walls
  ```
  I start by adding 4 StaticBody2D's as walls to my main scene, adding a CollisionShape2D as the child with a WorldBoundaryShape2D.
  Each wall extends into infinity, so I don't need to fiddle around with any sizes.
  For the right and left wall I attach a script that turns off the collision layer for this node on _ready() and activates it again when the game ends.
  This will make the ball bounce around forever when the game has ended, and I feel that it would be a cool end screen.
  ```
- Add paddles
  ```
  The paddles will become more complex over time and reused for each player, so I make this into a separate scene.
  I made it into a CharacterBody2D with a sprite and collision shape attached to it.
  Different up-and-down keyboard keys should control each paddle, so I made the actions an exported variable on each paddle.
  After implementing the movement, instantiating 2 paddles in the main scene, and customizing the actions, I could move both paddles with W & S and UP & DOWN arrows.
  ```
- Add a ball and make it bounce
  ```
  The ball was also made into a separate scene and made up of a character body with a sprite and collision shape.
  I also added a VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D to signal the ball itself if it exited the screen.
  Which side of the screen the ball exited was also tracked, making it easy to signal out that information for other components to interpret.
  I then added the logic to serve the ball and reset it if it exited the screen.
  Another component called GameManager would read these signals and signal back after some time that the ball can be served again.
  ```
- Add points
  ```
  Having that GameManager setup, it was easy to implement a point system.
  Inside the GameManager I just had to add one variable for each player's score and increment the proper one when the ball exited the screen.
  The GameManager would then signal that the points have been changed for any UI component to update.
  I also set the point limit and sent a game-over signal to all proper components if any player reached 11 points.
  Now I had a game loop and a cool end screen.
  ```

### Add more 
- Custom bounce on paddles
  ```
  Like in the original, the ball should change trajectory depending on where on the paddle it hits.
  I also wanted the speed to be affected the same way and have the speed increase each time the ball bounces off a paddle.
  I defined 2 functions for this: ball_velocity_after_bounce() and increase_ball_speed_after_bounce()
  These override the built-in function move_and_collide() that alters the velocity after a collision.
  So now: the closer the ball hits the edge of a paddle, the greater the angle and speed increase of the bounce.
  And if it hits dead center, there's almost no speed increase and the ball bounces in a straight line.
  ```
- Add menus (main, pause, settings)
  ```
  Regarding menus, I made a main, pause, and settings menu.
  The settings menu includes customizable gameplay properties, such as the size and speed of the ball and paddles.
  I also stored these settings and made some templates such as a Classic template, that plays close to the original.
  It is accessible from both the main and pause menus.
  And now the end screen takes you back to the main menu instead of reloading the game scene.
  ```
- Add AI
  ```
  The AI was added as 3 different types that can be modified in the settings.
  I also made it so that you could decide which paddle should have an AI and which shouldn't.
  So now both players and AI can play against AI.
  ```

### Final touches
- Add basic audio (SFX)
  ```
  For SFX I used an online tool called (JSFXR)[https://pro.sfxr.me/].
  I made 2 sounds for the ball: one when bouncing off the walls and one when bouncing off the paddles.
  I also made one sound for when a player misses a ball.
  ```
- Some final cleanups
  ```
  Then I went through everything and made some small cleanups and bug fixes.
  ```
- Add a splash screen and icon
  ```
  Lastly, I made a splash screen and a game icon.
  ```

### Outro
```
And that was it!
The game is on Itch and the source code is on GitHub.
The links for both of them are in the description.
I also remade Flappy Bird as the second game of the challenge, so subscribe if you want to see that video.
Alright, take care!
