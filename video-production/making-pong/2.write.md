## The Hook

Introduce what Pong is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made Pong in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro
- Short Pong history
  ```
  Manufactured and released by Atari on November 29th, 1972, Pong was to become the first successful commercial game.
  Since then, countless remakes have been made, making it one of the most popular first-game-to-make as an aspiring indie game dev.
  ```
- The 20 games challenge
  ```
  I'm participating in the '20 Games Challenge', which is about recreating 20 existing games.
  One of the first games to be remade is Pong, and this is my take on it.
  ```

### Add the basics
- Add walls
  ```
  I start by adding 4 StaticBody2D's as walls to my main scene, adding a CollisionShape2D as the child with a WorldBoundaryShape2D.
  Each wall extends into infinity, so I don't need to fiddle around with any sizes.
  For the right and left wall I attach a script that turns off the collision layer for this node on _ready() and activates it again when the game ends.
  This will make the ball bounce around forever when the game has ended, and I feel that it would be a cool end screen.
  ```
- Add paddles
  ```
  The paddles will become more complex over time and reused for each player, so I make this into a separate scene.
  I made it into a CharacterBody2D, which has a sprite and a collision shape attached to it.
  Each paddle should be controlled by different up-and-down keyboard keys, so I made the actions an exported variable on each paddle.
  After implementing the movement, instantiating 2 paddles in the main scene, and customizing the actions, I could move both paddles with W & S and UP & DOWN arrows.
  ```
- Add a ball and make it bounce
  ```
  The ball was also made into a separate scene and made up of a CharacterBody2D with a sprite and collision shape.
  I also added a VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D to signal the ball itself if it exited the screen.
  Which side of the screen the ball exited was also tracked, making it easy to signal out that information for other components to interpret.
  I then added in the logic to serve the ball, reset it if it exited the screen, and reserve again.
  Another component called GameManager would read these signals and signal back when the ball was ready to be served again.
  ```
- Add points
  ```
  Having that GameManager setup, it was easy to implement a point system.
  Inside the GameManager I just had to add one variable for each player's score and increment the proper one when the ball exited the screen.
  The GameManager would then signal that the points have been changed for any UI component to update.
  ```

### Add more 
- Custom bounce on paddles
  ```
  
  ```
- Add menus (main, pause, settings)
- Add AI

### Final touches
- Add basic audio (SFX)
- Some final cleanups
- Add a splash screen and icon
