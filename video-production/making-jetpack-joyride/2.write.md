[How to write a video script for YouTube (epidemicsound.com)](https://www.epidemicsound.com/blog/how-to-write-a-video-script-for-youtube/)

## Brief

```
I recreated Jetpack Joyride in Godot and this is how made it.
```

## The Hook

Introduce what Jetpack Joyride is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
```
Jetpack Joyride is a side-scrolling endless runner action game, released by Halfbrick Studios 2011.
Just like many games from this studio it was a massive hit, and still has a big following.
```
- The 20 games challenge
```
I'm part of a challenge named "The 20 games challenge", in which you recreate 20 existing games.
In this video I'll show you how I made Jetpack Joyride in Godot.
```

### Research and planning

- Reasearch and fill out GDD
```
The first thing I did was to collect everything I learned about the game in a GDD, or a Game Design Document.
```
- Create GitHub project and issues
```
With that I created all the tasks I needed to do in the form of GitHub issues.
In a new GitHub project I organized and planned out all the tasks.
I must admit that I had way too high ambitions when I first planned this out, and because of that the game took longer than it needed to.
But yeah, I learned my lesson and will keep thing simpler from now on.
```

### Prototype 1: scrolling level

```
My first goal was to make a the scrolling level.
I played around with the resolution of the project, while drawing the background pieces.
I then had it stay stationary until you tapped the screen, and then it started scrolling.
Easy enough.
The hardest part was to stitch the parallax layers together, but I got it to work eventually.
```

### Prototype 2: The player

- Recreate the sprites
```
Next: the player.
I had found some blurry sprites I could go from when I tried redrawing the character sprites.
I kept it simple though and just made the running and flying cycles.
```
- Collisions and flying
```
I added some collisions and made him fly whenever you tapped the screen.
The particle effects were really simple, but I disn't want to stay here too long, so it was good enough.
```

### Prototype 3: Challenge

- Make the first obstacle: zapper
```
The first obstacle I added was the zapper.
As you can see it was super simple with no animations or particles.
```
- Create the first iteration of a interval spawning system
```
I then made a first attempt in creating a interval spawning system for all obstacles, which I iterated on several times during the development.
```
- Make the speed increase over time
```
As in the original I made the speed increase over time.
```
- Add losing state
```
I then made you lose if you hit an obstacle.
Then this end screen appears, from which you could restart.
The end screen was improved several times as well before I was done with the game.
```

### Prototype 4: Distance/score

- Calculate the distance
```
As with all endless runners, you need to know how far you got.
So now it was time to add the distance meter.
```
- Save system
```
While implementing that, I also needed to implement a save system to be avle to save the score among other things.
```
- Highscore
```
I then made the game save your score if you reached the top 10.
The end screen was modified again to display this.
```

### Add coins

```
Time for some coins!
First I recreated the sprites.
I made them a collectible by the player.
And added the UI to display the collected coins.
They are of course also saved between sessions, and in the future it would be cool to add powerups which you can buy with the coins.
But yeah, a bit out of scope right now.
```

### Pause menu

```
The next thing to add was the pause menu.
It ended up similar to the end screen, but now you could pause the game!
```

### Some polish

- Add more obstacles/improve the spawning system
```
After this the game had more or less all the essentials, so now I just started to add more variation and polish.
First thing I did was to the missile to the game.
And once again I reiterated on the spawning system.
```
- Add audio
```
When I got to adding the audio I found a pack with all the original SFX from the game.
Since this project took so long I felt that I'll just go with that and started to add in the audio to the game using that pack.
I also shamefully used the original soundtracks as well.
```
- Final touches
```
I then finally just added a title to the start screen, added a splash screen, and a game icon.
Again I shamefully used the original splash screen and icon.
But yeah this is just a bad clone for learning and nothing serious.
```

### Outro

```
And with that it was done!
Or at least playable.

You can play the game on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
Both are linked in the description below.

Thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time.

Bye!
