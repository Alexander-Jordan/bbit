## The Hook

Introduce what Jetpack Joyride is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

```

```

### Outro

 With that I only did some final tweaks, added an icon, and a splash screen before exporting.

 The game is playable on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
