## The Script

### Intro

#### Short history

> Do you recognize this guy?
> You're not alone.
> Since its release back in 1978, Space Invaders took the arcades, and then world, by storm.
> Today, it's considered one of the most influential and greatest video games of all time.

#### The 20 games challenge

> I'm part of a challenge named "The 20 games challenge", in which you recreate 20 existing games.  
> In this video, I'll show you how I remade Space Invaders in Godot.  

### Planning

> For the last 2 games, I started the projects by filling in a GDD.
>
> GDDs are great, but recently I learned more about rapid prototyping.
>
> I learned that for early prototyping it's not always good to define the game too quickly.
> And I realized that I could get a lot more done faster when I:
> 1. Implement
> 2. Test
> 3. Tweak
> 4. Repeat
>
> It was also just faster to fetch information about a specific game feature when it was time to implement it, rather than doing all the research before-hand.
> So the only prep I did was creating small GH issues, with the instructions from the 20 Games Challenge page.

### Game project and ship

> After creating the project and setting it up, I made a main dark scene with 4 invisible walls.
>
> Then I started to build the player ship.
> I used a spritesheet I found online with all the sprites I needed for the game.
> And you could control the ship using a mouse or a finger on touchscreen devices.

#### Aliens

> In the original there were 3 types of aliens: Octopus, Crab, and Squid
>
> To spawn them I made a script called AlienRow, which were responsible for 1 row of aliens.
> I also made small, reusable components, like a spawnable and a spawner, to handle spawning and despawning.
>
> When the game starts it will spawn 5 rows, with 11 aliens on each row, just like the original.
> They will start moving right, and change direction when they collide with a wall, moving one step closer to the player each time.

#### Shooting

> To shoot the aliens I made a few reusable components like destructors, destructables, projectiles and a projectile pool.
> So the aliens have a destructable component, so that when a destructor enters it, it will deal damage, and it will eventually be destroyed when the health is too low.
> The projectiles contains the destructor component, and when the player shoots one it is added to the projectile pool to be reused later when the next shot is made.
>
> Doing this makes it easy to do the exact same things but in reverse: having the aliens shoot back at the player.
> Then the player also have the destructable component, and the aliens reuse projectiles from the same pool.
>
> When a destructable is destroyed, it sends a signal that is being acted on differently depending on the game object.
> For aliens: they should despawn by their spawnable component, and wait until they are respawned by their spawner (or row).
> For the player ship: it should disapear and reapper after a few seconds if there's any lives left.

### UFO

> Based on a random timer, a red UFO appears and cross the screen above the aliens.
> And when the player shoots it, they are rewarded some bonus points.
>
> I'll add the points later, but having all these components I made earlier makes creating the UFO a lot easier.
> Just like the aliens, the UFO has a spawnable and a destructable component.
> I made a custom spawner extending the spawner component, but most of the implementation are already done by the base spawner component.
>
> So pretty quickly I had a bonus UFO appearing randomly.
> And I also made the speed of the aliens increase everytime you shot an alien.

### UI, health, and score

> The game had most of the features implemented, and now it needed some UI.
> I added a score and highscore counter, together with a life counter.
> If the player dies, a restart button appears.
> And if the player clears the screen, it resets after a few seconds.
>
> The player should also lose instantly if the aliens reach the player ship.

### Final touches

> Time to finalize the game.
> First off I wanted to add a main menu, and I fixed some bugs I've made along the way.
>
> Then I added all the missing SFX and the game music.
>
> And lastly I added an icon, a splash screen, and exported the game.

### Outro

> And now the game was done!
> Or we should rather call it a prototype, but anyways.
>
> You can play the game on Itch, and the source code can be found on GitHub.  
> Both are linked in the description.
>
> Thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time.
>
> Bye!
