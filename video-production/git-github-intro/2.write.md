## Brief

This is how I was introduced to git & Github.
And all the challenges I faced while learning it.

## Outline

### Act 1: Set up
- Hook: Git & GitHub seems fantastic & widely used
- Introduction: Me before git/Github (storing projects on drive, used phone notes & Trello for planning)
- Inciting event: I discover git/Github from a video
- First plot point: I decide to learn and use git & GitHub

### Act 2: Confrontation
- First pinch point: Installing/Configuring git, create my first repo, and learning the commands via the terminal
- Midpoint: I want to backup this repo by sending it to GitHub, so I create an account
- Second pinch point: To setup git with GitHub I'll need to learn more about the terminal, ssh, and setting it all up on different machines
- Third plot point: I need more planning tools, so I learn about PRs, issues, milestones, Project Boards, and set them up

### Act 3: Resolution
- Climax: I finally got everything to work with my first project, and I also learn about GitHub Desktop, which makes some steps easier
- Resolution: I now use git/Github to develop & plan all my projects, and sometimes I use GitHub Desktop as well

## The Hook

Show off how fantastic & widely used Git & GitHub is.
