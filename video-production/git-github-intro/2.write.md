## Brief

This is how I was introduced to git & Github.
And all the challenges I faced while learning it.

## Outline

### Act 1: Set up

- Hook: Git & GitHub seems fantastic & widely used
- Introduction: Me before git/Github (storing projects on drive, used phone notes & Trello for planning)
- Inciting event: I discover git/Github from a video
- First plot point: I decide to learn and use git & GitHub

### Act 2: Confrontation

- First pinch point: Installing/Configuring git, create my first repo, and learning the commands via the terminal
- Midpoint: I want to backup this repo by sending it to GitHub, so I create an account
- Second pinch point: To setup git with GitHub I'll need to learn more about the terminal, ssh, and setting it all up on different machines
- Third plot point: I need more planning tools, so I learn about PRs, issues, milestones, Project Boards, and set them up

### Act 3: Resolution

- Climax: I finally got everything to work with my first project, and I also learn about GitHub Desktop, which makes some steps easier
- Resolution: I now use git/Github to develop & plan all my projects, and sometimes I use GitHub Desktop as well

## The Script

### Act 1: Set up

#### INT. SMALL OFFICE IN ALEX APARTMENT (DAY)

The blinking cursor of a terminal, similar to `The Matrix` opening scene.
Zooming out from a crisp screen recording, transitioning to the computer screen.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

Git and GitHub are used by millions.
With git you can track every change in your local project - every file, every line.
It's easy to go back in time if you need to.
With GitHub it's possible to backup those projects.
You can share them with others just to show off or to collaborate.
It's also packed with so many planning tools.
And it's all free.
Sounds amazing, I know.
I just didn't know about it.
```

The terminal is typing out `exit`, hits enter quickly, and closes down.
With a bunch of key presses ALEX launches Unity hub.

MUSIC KICKS IN. The camera slowly zooms in from the corridor into the small office.  
ALEX lean back in his chair while looking at the screen, drinking water from a bottle.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

I love making games.
All the parts of it.
And I even had participated in some Game Jams, getting some momentum in finishing them.
```

ALEX turns around in the chair and plugs in an external hard drive into the PC.  

```
ALEX (V.O.)

And I store them all in a external hard drive, together with everything else.
I like being able to plug it into any machine, and just continuing from where I left off.
```

From behind the screen, ALEX turns back to it and opens up a new window.  
Now from behind ALEX, on the screen is the Trello dashboard in the browser.  
ALEX briefly looks through some of the boards and their cards.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

I plan out all my games using Trello.
It's such a great way of getting stuff done, and I love ticking off the boxes.
But one of my favorite YouTuber's mentioned something I can't stop thinking about.
```

ALEX opens up a new tab and goes to YouTube.  
From behind the screen, ALEX finds a [Sebastian Lague video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIMHRQWorkE&t=43s) where he talks about using Version Control for all his projects.  
ALEX starts to search for the term `Version Control` and eventually finds the official git website, and reads about git.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

Git seemed like a great tool - recording the history of my projects, making it easy to manage and revert mistakes.
This could be the missing piece of my developing process.
The only thing was that I didn't know much about the terminal, and it looked like I had to use it extensively for this.
(a beat)
```

POV from the screen facing ALEX's face, ALEX leans back a bit and stares into the screen thinking anxiously.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

But I had to do it.
```

ALEX leans back into the screen, starting the process of learning git.

### Act 2: Confrontation

MONTAGE.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

In order to learn git well, I decided to learn the terminal well.
I learned basic stuff like printing out text, the current directory, moving around, manipulating and listing folders, files, and text's.
I learned about input, output, pipes, even writing, installing and running small scripts.
```

Screen recording of ALEX learning and testing out the terminal. Every command is zoomed in and executed.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

This was not easy to grasp.
And sometimes pretty scary.
```

From behind the screen, ALEX is noticeably struggling to learn, cutting between different poses as time progress.  
POSE 1: leaned back thinking.  
POSE 2: leaned up close to the screen.  
POSE 3: slowly types something.  
POSE 4: holding one of his hands in front of his face while hitting enter.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

But now I had a good understanding of the terminal, and a great base for learning git.
So I installed it, followed the instructions to configure it, and initialized my first git project (a.k.a repository).
Just a small project for important documentation for now, to test it out.
```

Switching between screen recording and POV from the screen of ALEX following along the [git getting-started documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install, configure, and initialize git in a new project.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

While developing my project, I learn basic git commands like how to check the status, view changes, stage and un-stage files, and create commits with a custom message.
I also learn about branching, merging, and list history logs and differences.
```

Screen recording of ALEX learning and testing git. Every command is zoomed in and executed.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

Despite some obvious learning pains, I started to enjoy git and the control it gave me over my project.
```

Semi profile view of ALEX's face, struggling a bit but changing into relief.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

It felt amazing to drop the fear of changing stuff, because I could experiment freely in a separate branch, and always revert the changes if I needed to.
```

Screen recording of creating a new branch for the project, cutting to view from outside the small office zooming out with a pleased ALEX leaned into the screen.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

It was a game changer.
(a beat)
But now I discovered something else.
```

POV from the screen, a happy ALEX leans back (for a beat).  
INTENSE MUSIC STARTS AND RISES IN VOLUME FROM LOW TO HIGH  
ALEX's face turns serious and he leans back into the screen, clicking with his mouse as he reads about [git remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).  
ALEX highlight some key phrases such as [remote repositories](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes#:~:text=to%20manage%20your-,remote%20repositories,-.%20Remote%20repositories%20are), [Adding Remote Repositories](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes#:~:text=Adding%20Remote%20Repositories), and [github.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes#:~:text=add%20pb%20https%3A//-,github.com,-/paulboone/ticgit%0A%24%20git).  
Then ALEX continues to read about [GitHub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration) and highlights phrases such as [GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration#:~:text=GitHub%20is%20the%20single%20largest%20host%20for%20Git%20repositories), [Account Setup and Configuration](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration#:~:text=Git%20Tools.-,Account%20Setup%20and%20Configuration,-The%20first%20thing), and [set up a free user account](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration#:~:text=set%20up%20a%20free%20user%20account)

```
ALEX (V.O.)

With GitHub I could store my projects for free on the cloud, and be able to access them anytime.
I wouldn't even have to keep them in my external hard-drive to be able to continue from another machine - ANY machine.
This was too good, I had to try it.
```

POV from screen, ALEX is thinking intensely, then turns around to the hard-drive behind him. POV from the hard-drive, ALEX stares at it while thinking. Cutting to a CU of the hard-drive, and back to POV from the hard-drive while ALEX continues to stare at it.  
Cut back to POV from the screen, ALEX turns back to it and stares at the link to github.com. From a screen recording, ALEX is dragging the mouse to the link, and clicks it.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

First I created the account.
I then continued to follow the guide I had and setup a public SSH key - while learning what even SSH is.
Small details like profile picture and email addresses as well.

```

From a screen recording, ALEX follows [the guide to create and configure  the GitHub account](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration).  
We sometimes switch between the screen recording and POV from the screen to see ALEX's face as he set everything up.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

Now it was time to upload my project to GitHub.
So I created a new repository on GitHub with the same name, added no new files, and then linked it with my git repository as the remote.
And now all I had to do was to push...
(a beat)
```

From a screen recording, ALEX creates the repository on GitHub, and then from the terminal links it as the remote to the local repository.  
Then types out `git push`, and waits a beat.  
POV of the screen, ALEX looks scared and excited. Cut to TOP-DOWN view over the keyboard, with ALEX fingers over the ENTER key.  
Cut to the screen again, CU of the command, as ALEX hits enter.  
Cuts to zoomed out view of the terminal as it progresses, and when it's done cut from behind the screen to see ALEX face being surprised it's all done.

```
ALEX (V.O.)

YES!
It worked!
It's all there.
```

Back to the screen recording, ALEX switch back to GitHub and refreshes the page: SUCCESS! All files are there.
From behind the screen, ALEX jumps a bit in his chair as he raises his fist up in the air of excitement.  
ALEX skims through the files in the GitHub repository to see that it's all there.

```
I immediately wanted to try if I could clone the project, so I tried and: SUCCESS!
It's all here, and if I ever wanted to, I could clone it on any machine without the need of my hard-drive.
```

Switch between screen recording and viewing ALEX from behind the screen, ALEX clones the repository from GitHub in another place on the same machine.  
ALEX then skims through the files to see that everything is there.

### Act 3: Resolution
