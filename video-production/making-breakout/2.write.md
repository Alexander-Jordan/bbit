## The Hook

Introduce what Breakout is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
```
Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. and released on May 13, 1976
```
- The 20 games challenge
```
I'm part of a challenge named "The 20 Games Challenge", in which you recreate 20 existing games.
In this video I'll show how I recreated Breakout in Godot.
```

###  Research and planning

- Reasearch and fill out GDD
```
First I did some research.
I collected everything I learned in a Game Design Document, or GDD.
```
- Create GitHub project and issues
```
From that I created GitHub issues to reflect what I wanted to create.
I then added them to a GotHub project, in which I could order and plan the tasks.
Now I was ready to create.
```

### Main scene

- Create and setup project
```
I knew I wanted to have the game in portrait mode, much like the original and also because I wanted it to be mote mobile friendly.
So I setup the projects resolution, and then I created the main scene.
```
- Add game boundaries
```
For now all I needed to add here was the world boundaries, so some walls and a ceiling.
```

### Add paddle

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Next was the paddle.
So a new scene, and some simple rectangle sprite.
```
- Add collisions and restrictions
```
It should of course have some collisions, both to not pass the walls, and also for making the ball bounce off it.
Restrictions to the y-axis was also added now.
```
- Controll with mouse or finger
```
How the player controls the paddle could vary between using the mouse, or a finger on touchscreen devices.
```

### Add ball

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Time for the ball.
Just like the paddle: a new scene, and some simple square sprite for visuals.
```
- Serve, and bounce
```
I had the ball spawn just above the paddle, and when the player tap or click the screen the ball is served.
When served it flies in a random direction within an angle boundary.
And it can bounce off the walls and paddle.
```
- Reset if it goes outside the screen
```
If the ball goes outside the screen, the ball resets and you can play again.
```

### Add bricks

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Let's add some more to the gameplay: bricks.
As before, a new scene and a simple rectangle sprite.
```
- 4 different types/colors
```
This time it will have 4 different types and colors.
And soon they will also result in different points.
```
- Create a brick handler
```
To spawn the bricks I created a brick handler.
It will also keep track of how many bricks are left.
```
- The ball bounces off bricks and destroys them
```
Now when the ball hits a brick it bounces off it, just like with walls and paddle.
But it also destroys the brick, making it possible to clear the screen.
```

### GameManager and score

- Add a simple game manager
```
Before I could add anything related to score or game states, I needed a game manager.
So I created one which is accessible as a global script (much like a singleton), and added different properties I needed it to keep track of.
```
- Update the score when bricks are destroyed
```
Now I could update the score when a brick is destroyed directly from the brick itself.
I could also pass in exactly how much points you get depending on which type of brick is destroyed pretty easily.
```
- Add UI for the score
```
And then we need some way of displaying this, so I added the score UI on the top.
```

### "Win" and lose condition


- Clear the screen
```
In this game you can't win, you just rack up points until you lose or give up.
But we still need to the screen to reset when the all bricks are cleared.
So I made the brick handler do just that.
```
- Setup lives
```
To setup the lose condition I first started with giving the player 3 lives.
```
- Setup losing condition
```
Whenever the player loses all lives, then we set the game state to game over.
```
- End screen with restart button
```
When the game is over, you should be able to either restart or quit the game.
```

### Ball speed and hard mode

- Implement the ball speed increase similar to the original
```
Different Breakout versions handles the speed of the ball differently.
In the original Breakout however you had 4 stages of speed:
- Default speed
- 2 times the default speed after 4 brick hits
- 4 times the default speed after 12 brick hits
- And 8 times the default speed after a orange or red brick is hit
So I implemented that as well.
```
- Implement the hard mode similar to the original
```
Another special thing in the original game was that when you hit the ceiling, your paddle shrinks.
It makes the game super difficult, but I implemented that as well.
```

### Outro

 ```
 With that I only did some final tweaks, added an icon, and a splash screen before exporting.

 The game is playable on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
 Both are linked in the description below.

 Thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time.

 Bye!
