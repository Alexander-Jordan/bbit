## The Hook

Introduce what Breakout is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
```
Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. and released on May 13, 1976
```
- The 20 games challenge
```
I'm part of a challenge named "The 20 Games Challenge", in which you recreate 20 existing games.
In this video I'll show how I recreated Breakout in Godot.
```

###  Research and planning

- Reasearch and fill out GDD
```
First I did some research.
I collected everything I learned in a Game Design Document, or GDD.
```
- Create GitHub project and issues
```
From that I created GitHub issues to reflect what I wanted to create.
I then added them to a GotHub project, in which I could order and plan the tasks.
Now I was ready to create.
```

### Main scene

- Create and setup project
```
I knew I wanted to have the game in portrait mode, much like the original and also because I wanted it to be mote mobile friendly.
So I setup the projects resolution, and then I created the main scene.
```
- Add game boundaries
```
For now all I needed to add here was the world boundaries, so some walls and a ceiling.
```

### Add paddle

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Next was the paddle.
So a new scene, and some simple rectangle sprite.
```
- Add collisions and restrictions
```
It should of course have some collisions, both to not pass the walls, and also for making the ball bounce off it.
Restrictions to the y-axis was also added now.
```
- Controll with mouse or finger
```
How the player controls the paddle could vary between using the mouse, or a finger on touchscreen devices.
```

### Outro

 ```
 With that I only did some final tweaks, added an icon, and a splash screen before exporting.

 The game is playable on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
 Both are linked in the description below.

 Thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time.

 Bye!
