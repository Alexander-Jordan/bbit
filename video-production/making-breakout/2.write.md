## The Hook

Introduce what Breakout is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
```
Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari back in 1976.
What's cool to think about is that giants like Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (you might know them for being part of the OG Apple company) were part of the design team of the OG Breakout.
```
- The 20 games challenge
```
I'm part of a challenge named "The 20 Games Challenge", in which you recreate 20 existing games.
In this video I'll show you how I recreated Breakout in Godot.
```

###  Research and planning

- Reasearch and fill out GDD
```
First I did some research.
I collected everything I learned about the game in a Game Design Document, or GDD.
```
- Create GitHub project and issues
```
From that I created GitHub issues to reflect what I needed to create.
I then added them to a GitHub project, in which I could order and plan the tasks.
Now I was ready to create.
```

### Main scene

- Create and setup project
```
I knew I wanted to have the game in portrait mode like the original, but also because I wanted it to be more mobile friendly.
So I setup the projects resolution, and then I created the main scene.
```
- Add game boundaries
```
For now all I needed to add here was the world boundaries, so some walls and a ceiling.
```

### Add paddle

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Next was the paddle, with a simple rectangle sprite.
```
- Add collisions and restrictions
```
It should of course have some collisions, both to not pass the walls, and also for making the ball bounce off it.
```
- Controll with mouse or finger
```
How the player controls the paddle could vary between using the mouse, or a finger on touchscreen devices.
```

### Add ball

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Time for the ball.
Just like the paddle: a simple square sprite for visuals, and collisions.
```
- Serve, and bounce
```
I had the ball spawn just above the paddle and lock it to the paddle movements.
When served it flies in a random direction, and it bounces off the walls and paddle.
```
- Reset if it goes outside the screen
```
If the ball goes outside the screen, the ball resets and you can reserve.
```

### Add bricks

- Create the scene and add sprites
```
Let's add some more to the gameplay: bricks.
As before, a simple rectangle sprite and collisions.
```
- 4 different types/colors
```
This time it will have 4 different types and colors.
And soon they will also result in different points.
```
- Create a brick handler
```
To spawn the bricks I created a brick handler.
It will also keep track of how many bricks are left.
```
- The ball bounces off bricks and destroys them
```
When the ball hits a brick it bounces off it, just like with walls and paddle.
But it also destroys the brick, making it possible to clear the screen.
```

### GameManager and score

- Add a simple game manager
```
Before I could add anything related to score or game states, I needed a game manager.
So I created one which is accessible as a global script (much like a singleton), and added different properties I needed it to keep track of.
```
- Update the score when bricks are destroyed
```
Now I could update the score when a brick is destroyed directly from the brick itself.
I could also pass in exactly how much points you get depending on which type of brick is destroyed pretty easily.
```
- Add UI for the score
```
And then we need some way of displaying this, so I added the score UI on the top.
```

### "Win" and lose condition

- Clear the screen
```
In this game you can't win, you just rack up points until you lose or give up.
But we still need the screen to reset when the all bricks are cleared.
So I made the brick handler do just that.
```
- Lives, losing, and end screen
```
To setup the lose condition I first started with giving the player 3 lives.
Whenever the player loses all lives, then we set the game state to game over.
When the game is over, you should be able to either restart or quit the game.
```

### Ball speed and hard mode

- Implement the ball speed increase similar to the original
```
Different Breakout versions handles the speed of the ball differently.
In the original Breakout however you had 4 stages of speed:
- Default speed
- 2 times the default speed after destroying 4 bricks
- 4 times the default speed after destroying 12 bricks
- And 8 times the default speed after destroying a orange or red brick
So I implemented that as well.
```
- Implement the hard mode similar to the original
```
Another special thing in the original game was that when you hit the ceiling, your paddle shrinks.
It makes the game super difficult, but I implemented that as well, so good luck.
```

### Some polish

- A main menu
```
You can't have a game without a menu, so here is a simple main menu.
```
- Add audio
```
Some classic SFX are also required for some game juice, created with JSFXR.
And to really pump you up I also found an awesome soundtrack from Pixabay.
```
- Stats and dev mode
```
And if you know me you know I love game stats.
So I added some stats you can nerd about.
By the way, I left some custom dev tools in the game for you to play around with.
How to use them are described on the game page.
```
- Add custom assets
```
From here I only did some final adjustments like adding custom assets, fonts, a splash screen, and an icon.
```

### Outro

```
The game is playable on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
Both are linked in the description below.

Thanks for watching and I hope to see you when I remake Jetpack Joyride.

Bye!
