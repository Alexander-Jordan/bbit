## The Hook

Introduce what Flappy Bird is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
  ```
  Flappy Bird.
  The rage game we all obsessed over in early 2014, which became one of the most recreated games of all time.
  ```
- The 20 games challenge
  ```
  I'm participating in the '20 Games Challenge', which is about recreating 20 existing games.
  In my first video I remade Pong, and now it's time to show you my take on Flappy Bird.
  ```

### Core gameplay

- Main `Start the game` scene
  ```
  I start off really simple, making a main scene with some text saying 'Tap to Flap'.
  When the player taps anywhere on the screen, the game starts, which just hides the text for now.
  ```
- Add a player
  ```
  For the player my plan was just to make a bird with 2 frames: one hovering, and one flapping.
  But while I was here I also made 2 more frames: one when hitting the pipes, and one hitting the ground.

  As a new scene, the bird was made out of a CharacterBody2D, with a CollisionShape2D, Sprite2D, and AnimationPlayer2D added as children to it.
  After creating the animations out of the 4 frames I made, I could move on to scripting.

  I made it so that before the 'start_game' signal was emitted, the bird would hover.
  And when it was emitted, the bird would start falling towards the floor.
  When the player tapped the screen I applied a force upwards, and I played the flap animation.
  And that was pretty much it: no collisions or anything just yet.
  ```
- Add obstacles
  ```
  The pipe scene was made out of an Area2D and the sprite was divided into 2 parts: the top and bottom.
  This was responsible for detecting any collisions with the bird.
  It also had a function for positioning and scaling depending on if it was to be a top or bottom pipe.

  I then made a new scene called 'pipes', which was essentially responsible to pair up 2 pipes, move them from right to left of the screen, and handle any collision signals sent by any of them.
  It also had a VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D as a child, to be able to emit a signal whenever it entered or exited the screen.

  In the main scene I added a 'pipe_handler'.
  It was responsible to spawn and re-spawn pipe-pairs, listen for any collisions, and send a signal to the 'Game Manager' that all movement should stop if a collision happened.

  For the ground, this was just a grass tile to be repeated.
  For this I used a ParallaxBackground node with a ParallaxLayer as a child.
  The ground moves at the same speed as the pipes and emits the same 'stop all movement' signal to the 'Game Manager' whenever the bird collides with it - which in turn also stops the ground from moving.
  ```
- Losing condition
  ```
  To add a losing condition I just added a 'game_over' state to the 'Game Manager', and triggered it as well whenever the bird fell to the ground.
  
  A restart button would appear whenever the 'game_over' signal was emitted, and just reload the level when the player clicked on it.

  At this point I also added in the 2 collision animations for the bird.
  ```
- Add points
  ```
  Last thing for the game loop was to add points.
  So I added a point counter that appears after clicking start.

  A point is rewarded after passing a pipe pair, and for this I used an Area2D in-between the pipes to check whenever the bird exited that area after entering it.

  The total points are displayed on the end-screen, together with the restart button.
  ```

### Some Juiciness

- Audio
  ```
  With the core game loop in place, it was time for some polish.

  For SFX I used an online tool called 'JSFXR'.

  I made 2 sounds when colliding: one with the pipes and one with the ground.

  I also made a sound for earning points.
  
  For the flaps I found a woosh sound on 'Pixabay'.
  ```
- Parallax background
  ```
  For the background I made 4 layers: the sky, clouds, distant greenery, and closer trees.
  I then added them as a new ParallaxBackground and multiple ParallaxLayers. 
  ```
- Settings menu
  ```
  Instead of creating a dedicated settings menu, I instead made a main menu with some audio toggle buttons.

  I also added a stats button and a button for toggling the music at this time.
  I knew I wanted to add the functionality for these later, but I left them disabled for now.

  The end-screen now had 2 buttons: one for restarting, and one for going back to the menu.
  ```
- Best score
  ```
  Now I added best score.
  It displays on the end-screen with the most recent score, and gets saved properly.

  I also made sure your score gets saved even if you accidentally close down the window mid-game. Just a small detail I like.
  ```
- Improve buttons and audio
  ```
  So far I had only used default buttons, so it was time to improve on that.

  I made 2 sprites, or states, for each button: idle and pressed.
  The pressed button sprite was reused for disabled buttons.

  The buttons got a clicking sound I made, and some music was also added, which I found on 'Pixabay'.
  ```

### Replayability

- Medals
  ```
  For replayability I really wanted to add the medals to the game.
  So I recreated the 4 medals but with my bird's face on it.

  I wasn't sure how it was in the original, but I decided that you would get bronze for 10 points or more, silver for 25 points or more, gold for 50 points or more, and platinum for 100 points or more.
  ```
- Stats
  ```
  Lastly I wanted some stats; some more useful like: the amount of medals earned and dates, and some more unnecessary but fun like: the number of times you flapped or died without passing a single pipe.
  ```

### Outro

 ```
 With that I only did some final tweaks, added an icon, and a splash screen before exporting.

 The game is playable on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
 Both are linked in the description below.

 Thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time.

 Bye!
