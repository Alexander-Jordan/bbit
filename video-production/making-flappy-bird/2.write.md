## The Hook

Introduce what Flappy Bird is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
  ```
  Flappy Bird.
  The rage game we all obsessed over in early 2014, which became one of the most recreated games of all time.
  ```
- The 20 games challenge
  ```
  I'm participating in the '20 Games Challenge', which is about recreating 20 existing games.
  In my first video I remade Pong, and now it's time to show you my take on Flappy Bird.
  ```

### Core gameplay

- Main `Start the game` scene
  ```
  I start off really simple, making a main scene with some text saying 'Tap to Flap'.
  When the player taps anywhere on the screen, the game starts, which just hides the text for now.
  ```
- Add a player
  ```
  For the player my plan was just to make a bird with 2 frames: one hovering, and one flapping.
  But while I was here I also made 2 more frames: one when hitting the pipes, and one hitting the ground.

  As a new scene, the bird was made out of a CharacterBody2D, with a CollisionShape2D, Sprite2D, and AnimationPlayer2D added as children to it.
  After creating the animations out of the 4 frames I made, I could move on to scripting.

  I made it so that before the 'start_game' signal was emitted, the bird would hover.
  And when it was emitted, the bird would start falling towards the floor.
  When the player tapped the screen I applied a force upwards, and I played the flap animation.
  And that was pretty much it: no collisions or anything just yet.
  ```
- Add obstacles
  ```
  The pipe scene was made out of an Area2D and the sprite was divided into 2 parts: the top and bottom.
  This was responsible for detecting any collisions with the bird.
  It also had a function for positioning and scaling depending on if it was to be a top or bottom pipe.

  I then made a new scene called 'pipes', which was essentially responsible to pair up 2 pipes, move them from right to left of the screen, and handle any collision signals sent by any of them.
  It also had a VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D as a child, to be able to emit a signal whenever it entered or exited the screen.

  In the main scene I added a 'pipe_handler'.
  It was responsible to spawn and re-spawn pipe-pairs, listen for any collisions, and send a signal to the 'Game Manager' that all movement should stop if a collision happened.

  For the ground, this was just a grass tile to be repeated.
  For this I used a ParallaxBackground node with a ParallaxLayer as a child.
  The ground moves at the same speed as the pipes and emits the same 'stop all movement' signal to the 'Game Manager' whenever the bird collides with it - which in turn also stops the ground from moving.
  ```
- Losing condition
  ```
  To add a losing condition I just added a 'game_over' state to the 'Game Manager', and triggered it as well whenever the bird fell to the ground.
  
  A restart button would appear whenever the 'game_over' signal was emitted, and just reload the level when the player clicked on it.

  At this point I also added in the 2 collision animations for the bird.
  ```
- Add points
  ```
  Last thing for the game loop was to add points.
  So I added a point counter that appears after clicking start.

  A point is rewarded after passing a pipe pair, and for this I used an Area2D to check whenever the bird exited the area between the pipes after entering it.

  The total points are displayed after the game has ended together with the restart button.
  ```
