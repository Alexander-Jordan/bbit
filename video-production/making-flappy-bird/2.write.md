## The Hook

Introduce what Flappy Bird is, how it fits into the 20 games challenge, and show step by step how I made it in Godot.

It should be simple and clean, straight to the point.

It should serve as just chill entertainment but also as a low-key tutorial.

## The Script

### Intro

- Short history
  ```
  Flappy Bird.
  The rage game we all obsessed over in early 2014, which became one of the most recreated games of all time.
  ```
- The 20 games challenge
  ```
  I'm participating in the '20 Games Challenge', which is about recreating 20 existing games.
  In my first video I remade Pong, and now it's time to show you my take on Flappy Bird.
  ```

### Core gameplay

- Main `Start the game` scene
  ```
  I start off really simple, making a main scene with some text saying 'Tap to Flap'.
  When the player taps anywhere on the screen, the game starts, which just hides the text for now.
  ```
- Add a player
  ```
  For the bird I made 4 animation frames: 2 for flying and 2 for crashing.
  In a new scene I assembled the bird with all the components.

  I made the bird initially hover, and fall when ever the game started.
  When the player tapped the screen I applied a force upwards, and I played the flap animation.

  And that was pretty much it: no collisions or anything just yet.
  ```
- Add obstacles
  ```
  For the pipes I made one scene with a single pipe, one for a pair of pipes, and in the main scene I added a pipe handler to be responsible for spawning pipes from the right.
  
  The ground was just a grass tile to be repeated.
  So I used a ParallaxBackground node and a ParallaxLayer to create the effect.
  
  And now with all collsions in place, all movement stops whenever the player collides with a pipe or the ground.
  ```
- Losing condition
  ```
  To add a losing condition I just added a 'game_over' state to the 'Game Manager', and triggered it as well whenever the bird fell to the ground.
  
  A restart button would appear whenever the 'game_over' signal was emitted, and just reload the level when the player clicked on it.

  At this point I also added in the 2 collision animations for the bird.
  ```
- Add points
  ```
  Last thing for the game loop was to add points.
  So I added a point counter that appears after clicking start.

  A point is rewarded after passing a pipe pair, and for this I used an Area2D in-between the pipes to check whenever the bird exited that area after entering it.

  The total points are displayed on the end-screen, together with the restart button.
  ```

### Some Juiciness

- Audio
  ```
  With the core game loop in place, it was time for some polish.

  For SFX I used an online tool called 'JSFXR'.

  I made 2 sounds when colliding: one with the pipes and one with the ground.

  I also made a sound for earning points.
  
  For the flaps I found a woosh sound on 'Pixabay'.
  ```
- Parallax background
  ```
  For the background I made 4 layers: the sky, clouds, distant greenery, and closer trees.
  I then added them as a new ParallaxBackground and multiple ParallaxLayers. 
  ```
- Settings menu
  ```
  Instead of creating a dedicated settings menu, I instead made a main menu with some audio toggle buttons.

  I also added a stats button and a button for toggling the music at this time.
  I knew I wanted to add the functionality for these later, but I left them disabled for now.

  The end-screen now had 2 buttons: one for restarting, and one for going back to the menu.
  ```
- Best score
  ```
  Now I added best score.
  It displays on the end-screen with the most recent score, and gets saved properly.

  I also made sure your score gets saved even if you accidentally close down the window mid-game. Just a small detail I like.
  ```
- Improve buttons and audio
  ```
  So far I had only used default buttons, so it was time to improve on that.

  I made 2 sprites, or states, for each button: idle and pressed.
  The pressed button sprite was reused for disabled buttons.

  The buttons got a clicking sound I made, and some music was also added, which I found on 'Pixabay'.
  ```

### Replayability

- Medals
  ```
  For replayability I really wanted to add the medals to the game.
  So I recreated the 4 medals but with my bird's face on it.

  I wasn't sure how it was in the original, but I decided that you would get bronze for 10 points or more, silver for 25 points or more, gold for 50 points or more, and platinum for 100 points or more.
  ```
- Stats
  ```
  Lastly I wanted some stats; some more useful like: the amount of medals earned and dates, and some more unnecessary but fun like: the number of times you flapped or died without passing a single pipe.
  ```

### Outro

 ```
 With that I only did some final tweaks, added an icon, and a splash screen before exporting.

 The game is playable on Itch and the source code can be found on GitHub.
 Both are linked in the description below.

 Thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time.

 Bye!
